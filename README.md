# Obsidian MCP Connector

Connect your Obsidian vault to AI assistants and automation tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This plugin enables seamless integration between your knowledge base and MCP-compatible clients like Claude Code.

## Why Use This Plugin?

### 🎯 Intelligent Context, Minimal Tokens

**Precision Over Brute Force**
- **Surgical Retrieval**: Instead of overwhelming AI with your entire vault, precisely target only the notes that matter
- **Query-Driven Intelligence**: Harness Dataview's powerful query language to extract exactly what you need—no more, no less
- **Token Optimization**: Dramatically reduce token consumption by fetching context-relevant content, not your entire knowledge base
- **Metadata-Powered Filtering**: Leverage tags, dates, priorities, and custom fields to pinpoint information with laser precision

**The Difference**: Rather than dumping 1000+ notes into the AI's context window (exhausting tokens and diluting focus), ask "Show me high-priority project notes from this quarter" and receive only the 10 truly relevant documents. Your AI assistant stays focused, responsive, and cost-effective.

### 🚀 Transformative Benefits

- **AI-Powered Knowledge Orchestration**: Elevate your vault from static storage to an intelligent, queryable knowledge system
- **Sophisticated Task Mastery**: Craft and manage intricate task hierarchies with rich metadata through natural conversation
- **Dataview Synergy**: Unlock the full power of structured queries without wrestling with complex syntax
- **Universal Platform Support**: Seamlessly operate across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android—even fully self-contained on mobile
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Keep your knowledge sacred—everything runs locally with zero cloud dependencies
- **Battle-Tested Reliability**: Enjoy robust auto-reconnection and graceful error handling for uninterrupted workflow

## Key Features

### Task Management

## How It Works

The plugin uses a **unified WebSocket architecture** that works across all platforms:

```
MCP Client (Claude Code) ←→ Bridge Server ←→ Obsidian Plugin ←→ Your Vault
    (HTTP/MCP)                (WebSocket)        (Obsidian API)
```

1. **Bridge Server** runs locally and translates between HTTP/MCP and WebSocket protocols
2. **Obsidian Plugin** connects to the bridge and exposes vault operations as MCP tools
3. **MCP Clients** like Claude Code can then interact with your vault through natural language

**Supported Platforms:**
- ✅ Windows, macOS, Linux (full desktop support)
- ✅ Android (self-contained with Termux)
- ⚠️ iOS (requires external bridge server)

## Quick Start

### Option A: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Use the installation scripts to automatically download, build, and install:

```bash
# Linux/Mac - from your vault directory
cd /path/to/your/vault
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prashanth-BC/mcp-connector-for-obsidian/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Or specify vault path
./install.sh /path/to/your/vault

# Windows - from your vault directory
cd C:\path\to\your\vault
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prashanth-BC/mcp-connector-for-obsidian/main/install.bat
install.bat

# Or specify vault path
install.bat C:\path\to\your\vault
```

Then enable the plugin in Obsidian Settings → Community plugins → MCP Connector

### Option B: Manual Installation

```bash
# Build the plugin
npm ci
npm run build

# Copy to your vault
cp -r mcp-connector /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/
```

Enable the plugin in Obsidian Settings → Community plugins → MCP Connector

### 2. Launch the Workspace

**Option A: All-in-One Launcher (Recommended)**

Start both the bridge server and Claude Code in one command:

```bash
# Linux/Mac (uses tmux)
cd /path/to/your/vault
./start-mcp-workspace.sh

# Windows (uses Windows Terminal or separate windows)
cd C:\path\to\your\vault
start-mcp-workspace.bat
```

**Option B: Manual Launch**

Start components separately:

```bash
# Linux/Mac
.obsidian/plugins/mcp-connector/start-bridge.sh

# Windows
.obsidian\plugins\mcp-connector\start-bridge.cmd

# Wait for: [WS Bridge] ✅ Obsidian plugin connected - Bridge is now READY
```

### 3. Connect Your MCP Client (If Not Using Workspace Launcher)

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport http obsidian http://127.0.0.1:4125/mcp

# Or configure in .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4125/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Using It!

Ask your AI assistant to:
- "List all my tasks with high priority"
- "Search my notes for references to machine learning"
- "Create a task to review the project plan by Friday"
- "Show me all notes in the Projects folder"
